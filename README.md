# Water Quality Analysis Using Autoencoders 🚰🔬

## 📌 Overview  
This project aims to analyze water quality of Uttrakhand based on multiple parameters.The project has taken the data from the official website of Uttrakhand Government website. Water quality is assessed using key indicators such as:  

- **Temperature (°C)**  
- **pH Level**  
- **Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) (mg/l)**  
- **Electrical Conductivity (EC) (µS/cm)**  
- **Dissolved Oxygen (DO) (mg/l)**  
- **Chloride (mg/l), Hardness (mg/l), Calcium (mg/l), Magnesium (mg/l)**  
- **Alkalinity (mg/l), Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) (mg/l), Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) (mg/l)**  
- **Nitrate-N (mg/l), Phosphate (mg/l), Sodium (mg/l), Potassium (mg/l), Sodium Absorption Ratio (SAR)**  

These parameters are essential for assessing the overall quality and usability of water in different regions.  

## 🔍 Why Autoencoders?  
This project utilizes **Autoencoders**, a type of neural network designed for efficient data compression and feature extraction. Autoencoders help in:  

- **Dimensionality Reduction** → Reducing the complexity of high-dimensional water quality data.  
- **Feature Learning** → Extracting key patterns in water quality measurements.  
- **Anomaly Detection** → Identifying irregularities that indicate contamination or pollution.  
- **Data Reconstruction** → Handling missing values by learning from available data patterns.  

Autoencoders consist of:  
- **Encoder** → Compresses input data into a lower-dimensional latent representation.  
- **Decoder** → Reconstructs the original input data from the compressed form.  
This approach helps in analyzing trends, detecting anomalies, and predicting changes in water quality across states.
